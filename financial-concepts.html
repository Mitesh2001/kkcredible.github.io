                            <h4>Financial Concepts</h4>
                            <p>
                                Investing world is highly chaotic, confusing place and once you type in google on financial concept one would be flooded  with large no of jargons and sites explaining various financial concepts. Though Investing needs to be kept simple , world has made it very complex. I personally as an advisor believe in the simplicity of the concept and hence have tried to highlight only few concepts which are of atmost necessity in investments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here are some of the fundamental concepts of finance and investment.
                            </p>
                            <strong>Risk Vs Return</strong><br>
                            <strong>Diversification</strong><br>
                            <strong>Rupee Cost Averaging</strong><br>
                            <strong>Asset Allocation</strong><br><br><br>

                            <h5><strong>Risk Vs Return:</strong></h5>
                            <p>
                                Risk and Returns are directly proportional. Ie Higher the risk you take , higher should be your returns and vice versa.
                                But what amount of risk one can take while investing is the most important factor which generally financial planners like us have to take into account.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Risk means Chance that an investment's actual returns will be different than expected. There are 2 types of risk i.e <b>Actual risk vs Perceived Risk.</b> Most of the time when markets are trading at <b>high PE multiples the risk in equities are high and actual returns received should be low , So actual risk is high but in the mind of investor the perceived Risk is low</b> i.e they will readily invest into equities (same happens with all asset classes) based on past returns. <b>Similarly when markets have corrected ie it is trading at low PE mutiples risk in equities is less and actual returns if invested at that time will be high but Perceived risk is high based on past returns and so most investors do not invest during down cycle of equities</b>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This is one of the major role of financial planners, ie. to make clients understand the risk vs return tradeoff.
                            </p>

                            <br>

                            <h5><strong>Diversification:</strong></h5>
                            <p>
                                Diversification is a risk-management technique that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio in order to minimize the impact that any one security will have on the overall performance of the portfolio.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Diversification essentially lowers the risk of your portfolio. There are three main practices that can help you ensure the best diversification:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>your portfolio among multiple investment vehicles </strong>such as cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and perhaps even some real estate. Alternately you could invest only in mutual funds but of varied types. For example you could invest 30% in equity schemes, 40% in debt/income schemes and 30% in money market schemes. You could also invest in commodity funds or real estate funds although as and when permitted by SEBI.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>Vary the risk in your securities: </strong>If you are investing in equity funds, then consider large cap as well as small cap funds. And if you are investing in debt, you could consider both long term and short term debt. It would be wise to pick investments with varied risk levels; this will ensure that large losses are offset by other areas.
                            </p>

                            <br>

                            <h5><strong>Rupee Cost Averaging:</strong></h5>
                            <p>
                                If you ask any professional investor what their hardest task is, he or she will tell you that it is timing the market. Trying to time the market is a very tricky strategy. Buying at the absolute low and selling at the peak is nearly impossible in practice. This is why investment professionals preach rupee cost averaging (RCA).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                RCA is the process of buying fixed amounts into a security/stock/mutual fund at fixed points in time regardless of the prevailing price. This means you buy more units of the security at lower prices, and fewer units at higher prices. The cost per unit/share over time therefore averages out. This reduces the risk of investing a large amount in a single security/mutual fund at the wrong time.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This principle is very powerful and works best over long periods of time. The Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) launched by mutual funds work on this principle and are therefore a highly recommended investment option.
                            </p>

                            <br>

                            <h5><strong>Asset Allocation:</strong></h5>
                            <p>
                                It's no secret that throughout history equity as an asset class (the stock market) has outperformed most financial instruments. If an investor plans to have an investment for a long period of time, then their portfolio should be comprised mostly of stocks; however, investors who don't have this kind of time should diversify their portfolios, i.e. include investments other than stocks.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For this reason, the concept of "asset allocation" was developed. Asset allocation is an investment portfolio technique that aims to balance risk and create diversification by dividing assets among major categories such as bonds, stocks, real estate, and cash. Each asset class has different levels of return and risk, so each will behave differently over time. At the same time that one asset is increasing in value, another may be decreasing or not increasing as much.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The underlying principle of asset allocation is that the older a person gets, the less risk he or she should face. After you retire you may have to depend on your savings as your only source of income. It follows that you should invest more conservatively at this time since asset preservation is crucial.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Determining the proper mix of investments in your portfolio is extremely important. Deciding what percentage of your portfolio you should put into stocks, mutual funds, and low risk instruments like bonds and treasuries isn't simple, particularly for those reaching retirement age. Imagine saving for 30 or more years in the stock market only to see the stock market decline in the years just before your retirement! For many, this is what happened during the bear market of 2000 and 2001. Therefore one must change asset allocation over time to move more towards safer asset classes (bonds, treasuries) as one gets older. To determine your asset allocation plan, we suggest you speak to an investment advisor who can customize a plan that is right for you.
